'''
    This file contains the template for Assignment1.  For testing it, I will place it
    in a different directory, call the function <count_crossing>, and check its output.
    So, you can add/remove  whatever you want to/from this file.  But, don't change the name
    of the file or the name/signature of the following function.

    Also, I will use <python3> to run this code.
'''

def count_crossings(input_file_path, output_file_path):
    '''
        This function will contain your code.  It wil read from the file <input_file_path>,
        and will write its output to the file <output_file_path>.
    '''
    pass

'''
    To test your function, you can uncomment the following command with the the input/output
    files paths that you want to read from/write to.
'''
# count_crossings('', '')
